        Prepare for Your Trip
        You can travel safely by being well-prepared for your trip.
        Step 1: Once your flight is booked, view your airline’s travel requirements and guidance. Airline operations vary so it’s good to have a clear understanding of what you can expect before arriving at the airport. You can find the airlines that operate from SAN here.
        
        Step 2: Do your research. View the CDC’s COVID-19 travel guidance webpage for tips and information on traveling – they have resources for flying domestically or internationally for both fully-vaccinated and non-vaccinated individuals.
        
        Next, if you are traveling domestically visit your destination’s state, county, and city websites, they will have the most up-to-date information on any travel restrictions or requirements for travelers. If traveling internationally, check your destination’s country and city websites to get information on their travel guidance and restrictions.
        
        Step 3: You’ve checked with your airline and done your research, you are all packed, and now you’re headed to the airport. Please allow ample time to get to SAN and pass-through security. Check the TSA website for what you can pack and carry on, this page gives you more information on their coronavirus procedures. Parking at the airport? We suggest making reservations in advance here.
        
        Step 4: Some of our shops and restaurants have changed their operational days and/or times. Check our concessions page for more information on what is available during your travel time. Our concessions have increased their cleaning and put safety modifications in place to keep you healthy while on your journey.
        
        Step 5: Enjoy your trip

        FAQs
What are the cleaning procedures at SAN?
Our custodial provider is providing cleaning services 24-hours a day. They are placing an additional emphasis on public touchpoints in all areas, including handrails, bathroom stalls, seating, door handles, chairs and tables, touchscreen directories, concessions, and credit card machines. Further, in our parking lot and rental car shuttles, we are sanitizing seats, rails, and other surfaces several times daily, in addition to performing a deep clean twice weekly. We also use electrostatic spraying to disinfect and sanitize services.

What about air circulation in the terminals?

All HVAC systems at SAN were designed to meet the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers standards for ventilation for indoor air quality. Our systems meet or exceed industry filtration standards, meaning we filter the air at a recommended level between “Superior Commercial Buildings” and “Hospital Inpatient Care.” Additionally, 60 percent of air handlers installed in the airport contain ultraviolet light which provides extra protection to kill bacteria and viruses.
